Hello everyone!

Because the amount of coding opportunities is steadily - no wait, [deliberately][2] - opening wider and wider, I decided to make the website you see here. Yes, this is a reality, and no, robots aren't going to take over the world. People like to include a self destruct button in their projects, just in case anything goes wrong.

Hope you enjoyed!

PS: I've included an easter egg here. See if you can find it. [Hovering might be handy ;)][1]
